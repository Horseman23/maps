Leading the advance, the 11th Armoured Division's targets were Bras, Hubert-Folie, Verrieres and Fontenay; the Guards Armoured Division would push through around Cagny and Vimont; finally the 7th Armoured Division's objective was Garcelles-Secqueville. The intention was to push the Germans from the higher ground of the Bourguebus Ridge.||Allied preparatory fire was provided spectacularly by almost 1,000 heavy and medium bombers dropping over 15,000 bombs. The German positions to the east of Caen were carpet-bombed and many of the villages were reduced to rubble, disrupting the German defenses. However, the German artillery on the Bourgebus Ridge was not hit by the bombardment and by chance the defenders at Cagny and Emieville were largely unscathed. These sites had clear fields of fire into the path of the British advance.||Early advances by the Allied armour were made under a creeping barrage but were slow, despite encountering little resistance. But by noon the 11th Armoured Division's 29th Armoured Brigade had gained almost 12,000 yards.||By the time the Caen-Vimont railway was reached the Germans had recovered from the shock of the bombardment. The Fife and Forfar Yeomanry lost twelve tanks at Cagny when 88mm AA guns were turned on them. The Allies slowly pushed through and crossed the railway line to approach the German-held ridge at Bourgebus, where they encountered elements of the 21st Panzer Division, the Panther battalion of the 1st SS Panzer Division and numerous towed guns. For most of the day only the 29th Armoured Brigade of the 11th Armoured Division was attacking. The 159th Infantry brigade was held up clearing two villages behind the tank brigade.||The remaining two armoured divisions were still negotiating the river crossings and minefield. The Guards Armoured Division took all day to clear the defenders from Cagny. and when they had done so, attacked in a divergent direction towards Vimont to the south east, Unscathed defenders with well dug in anti-tank guns halted them and knocked out 60 tanks. By dusk only a single armoured regiment of the 7th Armoured Division was in action; most of the division did not finish crossing the Orne until 10pm on the 18th and could not add its weight to the attack. Thus the 11th Armoured Division was carrying the attack by itself most of the day.||The German armour counter-attacked late in the afternoon and fighting continued along the high ground and around Hubert-Folie on the 19th and 20th, bringing the attack to a halt. It is estimated that about 400 tanks were lost, including about half the tanks in the 29th Armoured Brigade.||",FallbackName="D-Day +42 - Cagny")
