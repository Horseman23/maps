This force comprised of elements of B and D Companies, 2nd Battalion, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, a platoon of B Company, Royal Engineers, and men of the Glider Pilot Regiment. The object of this action was to prevent German armour from crossing the bridges and attacking the eastern flank of the landings at Sword Beach. Howard had been told to take the bridges and hold until relieved.||Five of the Ox and Bucks's gliders landed within 40 yards from their objectives at 16 minutes past midnight. The attackers poured out of their battered gliders, completely surprising the German defenders, and took the bridges within 10 minutes losing only two men in the process, Lieutenant Denholm Brotheridge and Lance-Corporal Fred Greenhalgh.||One glider, assigned to the capture of Ranville Bridge, landed some 7 miles off, although the men from this glider moved through the German lines towards Ranville where they eventually rejoined the rest of the force. About half-an-hour after the landings the Ox & Bucks were reinforced by 7th Battalion, The Parachute Regiment and held the bridges against german counter attacks until about 1300hrs when the sound of bagpipes heralded the arrival of their relief, Lord Lovat's Commandos.||In honour of the British liberators, Bénouville Bridge was renamed Pegasus Bridge after the insignia worn by the Ox and Bucks while Ranville Bridge became known as Horsa Bridge.",FallbackName="Normandy 1944, Bénouville, Pegasus Bridge")
