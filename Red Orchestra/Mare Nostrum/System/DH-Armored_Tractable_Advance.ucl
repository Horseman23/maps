It was part of a wider allied attempt to encircle and trap much of the German army in Normandy. German forces strove to hold the gap as long as they could, to allow as many units as possible to escape and flee east.||Here, a Canadian mixed battlegroup must force a way through stubborn German defences to seize the area around the village of Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives. This must be done quickly, as the longer it takes, the more Germans can escape the encirclement. German forces, with armored support, just need to hold on long enough.",FallbackName="Operation Tractable, Saint-Lambert-sur-Dives")
