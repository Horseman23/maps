The people of Leningrad, starving, cold, and diseased have endured the German onslaught thus far. Thousands have died before them, and thousands more will die. This day alone, like so many days before it, will claim the lives of 4000 men, women, and children from starvation and exposure alone. They do not flee, because there is nowhere to flee to. They lack the strength to fight, and yet they will fight for Leningrad!",FallbackName="Leningrad - January 1942")
