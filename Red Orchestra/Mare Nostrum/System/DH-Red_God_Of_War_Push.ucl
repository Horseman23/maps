The target in this case was Model's 9th Army. Unlike 6th Army, the 9th was no easy target. Having sat in the Rzhev salient for almost a year, the german defenders were well entrenched and had ample mobile reserves. The result was a disaster for the soviets.||This map is based on a night attack by the 35th Mechanized Brigade against the 2nd Luftwaffe Field Division. The Luftwaffe troops managed to put up a spirited defense, but were unable to stop the soviet tanks, which rumbled up to the defenses and blasted the germans at point blank range. After a sharp fight, the germans melted in the woods surrounding the town. The soviets had won the initial fight, but that was only the beginning.",FallbackName=" Red God of War")
