The assault, scheduled to jump off just after midnight on the 10th, was for the 327th GIR to cross the Douve at Brévands, circle east and assault via the road from Isigny while the 502nd PIR was to attack from the southwest along the causeway of highway N13 blocking the German retreat. The causeway crossed flooded marsh areas between Ste Come-du-Mont and Carentan which concealed well prepared German MG and sniper positions.||Led by Lt.Col. Robert G. Cole, the 502nd found themselves in a fierce 2 day battle against their German counterparts, the fallschirmjager of FJR6, to push along the causeway taking the 4 bridges that spanned the Douve River and the Vire-Taute Canal. Under heavy fire, the Americans were forced to advance by crawling along the exposed road between bridges 3 and 4, the high casualties sustained earning the causeway the nickname of 'Purple Heart Lane'.",FallbackName="D-Day +4 - Carentan Causeway")
