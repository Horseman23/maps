The Germans sent forces to relieve the city. This is a meeting engagement between German and Soviet armoured forces, as the German SS Panzer Divisions attempt to push forward to relieve the trapped defenders of Budapest.||Both sides move forward rapidly with the aim of seizing the key river crossings near the village of Barashka. The first is a railway bridge, the other a little road bridge extending from a small peninsula in the river. Both sides have support from heavy tanks and artillery, as well as small numbers of infantry.",FallbackName="Barashka: Hungary, 25th January 1945")
