Patton's Third Army was spearheading the Allied advance eastward, and as his forces attacked into Lorraine, they seemed on the verge of penetrating the Westwall defenses into Germany itself. However, Patton's right flank was exposed while the US 6th Army Group moved northward along the Swiss frontier, having landed a month earlier in southern France. So by massing several of the newly formed Panzer brigades, Hitler prepared for a major armored counteroffensive in Lorraine. His aim was to encircle and destroy Patton's forces. To lead this audacious attack and head up the Fifth Panzer Army, he chose one of his youngest and most aggressive tank commanders, Gen. Hasso von Manteuffel. This .would be the largest German panzer counterattack on the Western Front and one of the largest tank versus tank battles fought by the US Army in World War II.||This Scenario depicts a fictional encounter between advancing elements of the newly formed Panzer Brigade 113 and elements of Combat Command A (CCA) of the 4th Armored Division outside of the Village of La Monderie, September, 1944.
