Snow-clogged forests leave only a few paths that tanks can travel while hidden. Many stop in dead ends.  Nothing can be assumed in this situation. Fire may come from a kilometer or more away or from less than 100 meters. Narrow paths break out into open country with long fields of view.||Superior German tanks are available in quantity during the initial phase of battle but, this German advantage can be burned up by a staunch Allied defense. The US forces must wisely employ their AT weapons as well as their tanks.",FallbackName="Freyneux and Lamormenil")
