The 12th SS Panzer Divsion (Hitlerjugend) had effectively prepared an armored counter attack against the Canadian forces. The young German soldiers then attacked the Canadian positions on the morning of June 8th. A fierce fight went on with the Hitlerjugend piercing the Canadian position with their Panthers.
