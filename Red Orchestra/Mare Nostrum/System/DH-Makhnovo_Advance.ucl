This happened at the end of June and was momentarily successful.||The counterattack, however, soon fizzled out and the Soviet high command called a general retreat in the area on the 30th June. Red units were either surrounded or fled headlong. This map covers the retreat of remnants of the 228th rifle division through the fictional village of Makhnovo, just north of Rovno around July 7th and their encounter with the unusually well equipped German 25th Motorised Infantry Division.",FallbackName="Makhnovo Village")
