For 48 hours the small Belgian village of Noville was held by a small mixed force of US Armored-Infantry, Tank Destroyer Battalions and Paratroopers as part of "Team Desobry". Desperately trying to buy time for defences to be established at the town of Bastogne, this ragtag band of armor and infantry managed to hold off a significant force of the 2nd Panzer Division in near zero visibility conditions before ultimately withdrawing to Bastogne itself.
