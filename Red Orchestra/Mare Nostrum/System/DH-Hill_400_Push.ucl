Critical to this engagement is the vitally important Castle Hill or "Hill 400", which its situated between Bergstein and Zerkall.||Hill 400 commands the terrain for miles around. The defenders not only have an excellent view over the entire combat area, but they also coordinate their artillery from this position. The Americans attack from two sides: along the Brandenberg-Bergstein ridge, and out of Vossenack through the Tiefenbach valley towards Bergstein. Success is not guaranteed-the outnumbered German defenders hold a strong position.",FallbackName="Hill 400")
